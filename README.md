# Stockguard Take-Home Assessment: URL Shortener

**Note:** Please do not share this assignment or your work on it with anyone else. If you are using a GitHub repository, make sure that it is private.

# 🔗 URL shortener

Long URLs aren't easy to email, tweet, or otherwise share. We'd like to see how you would implement a URL-shortening service.

# 🛠️ What you'll build

Your task is to build a web application that creates short URLs from long ones.

# 🗒️ Assignment details

- Choose any language / framework to build the application.
- You should have been notified via email about the deadline for your submission.
- We estimate that the required functionality will take between 3 and 5 hours to complete.
- If you have completed the assignment before the deadline and are satisfied with your work, you are encouraged to submit it early.
- Please cite any boilerplate code and third party libraries you used in your `README.md`.
    - If there are any ideas that you thought of for the project but didn't have time to implement, please include them in the README as well! Learning more about your thought process is very helpful.
- If you have any questions about the assignment, please contact Kevin Chappell at [kevin@stockguard.io](mailto:kevin@stockguard.io).

# ☑️ Required functionality

**You must create the following:**

- [ ] An API that allows consumers to...
    
    - [ ] a. provide an original URL and receive a shortened URL in return.
    
    - [ ] b. provide a short URL and visit the original URL.
    
- [ ] A web application for users to access the service's features.

**Bonus points if you are able to provide:**

- A one-line command that begins running the application (both frontend and backend) to assist us with getting it up and running to evaluate.

**Other details:**

- If you decide to use a hosted MongoDB cluster, please add the CIDR `0.0.0.0/0` to allow connections from anywhere. More details here: [https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security/ip-access-list/](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security/ip-access-list/)

# 📥 Submission

---

The application does not need to be deployed. Please include in the `README.md` any necessary instructions for running or testing the application locally.

Additionally, to submit your code, please create a **private** GitHub repository and invite the following GitHub users to it (`usernames` are in parentheses):

- Kierste Miller (`kierste-stockguard`)
- Nimesh Yogarajan (`nimesh03`)
- Kevin Chappell (`kevinchappell`)

And then include the link to the repository in an email to [kevin@stockguard.io](mailto:kevin@stockguard.io).
